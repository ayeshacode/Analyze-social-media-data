Instagram Data Sentiment Analysis Report
1. Introduction
This project involves sentiment analysis on Instagram data to understand public sentiment towards specific topics, posts, and interactions on Instagram. The analysis leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to preprocess text data from Instagram captions, extract sentiment scores, and visualize trends over time.

2. Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis includes various metrics from Instagram, such as:

Impressions: Total number of impressions on the post.
Likes, Comments, Shares: User engagement metrics.
Profile Visits, Follows: How many people visited the profile and followed after seeing the post.
Caption: The text accompanying the post, which is the main focus for sentiment analysis.
Hashtags: Relevant hashtags used in the post.
3. Data Preprocessing
To prepare the data for sentiment analysis, we performed the following steps:

Cleaning Text: Removed URLs, non-alphabetic characters, and converted the text to lowercase.
Tokenization: Split the text into individual words.
Stopword Removal: Removed common words that do not carry sentiment (e.g., "the", "and").
4. Sentiment Analysis
We used the TextBlob library to analyze the sentiments of Instagram post captions. Each caption was assigned a polarity score:

Positive sentiment: Polarity score > 0.
Negative sentiment: Polarity score < 0.
Neutral sentiment: Polarity score = 0.
Example of Sentiment Scores:
Caption	Cleaned Caption	Sentiment	Sentiment Label
"Had an amazing day at the beach!"	had an amazing day beach	0.75	Positive
"Really disappointed with the service"	really disappointed service	-0.6	Negative
5. Key Findings
Sentiment Distribution: A majority of the captions had a positive sentiment, with a smaller proportion of neutral and negative posts.
Engagement vs Sentiment: Positive sentiment posts tend to have higher likes and comments compared to neutral or negative sentiment posts.
Hashtags and Sentiment: Posts with certain hashtags are more likely to have positive sentiment.
6. Visualizations
a. Sentiment Distribution
A bar plot showing the distribution of sentiment (positive, neutral, negative) across the dataset.

python
Copy code
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

sentiment_counts = df['Sentiment_Label'].value_counts()
plt.bar(sentiment_counts.index, sentiment_counts.values, color=['green', 'gray', 'red'])
plt.title('Sentiment Distribution')
plt.ylabel('Number of Captions')
plt.show()
b. Average Likes by Sentiment
A bar plot showing the average number of likes per post for each sentiment category.

python
Copy code
df.groupby('Sentiment_Label')['Likes'].mean().plot(kind='bar', color=['green', 'gray', 'red'])
plt.title('Average Likes by Sentiment')
plt.ylabel('Average Likes')
plt.show()
7. Conclusion
Positive sentiment posts generally receive more engagement in terms of likes and comments.
Analyzing Instagram data through NLP techniques helps provide valuable insights into how people interact with posts and how their sentiments affect overall engagement.
